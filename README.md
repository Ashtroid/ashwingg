Ashwin.gg is a League of Legends Match History Visualizer, using the API provided by Riot Games to neatly display all Ranked Solo/Duo Queue games by username. We provide a minimal approach to displaying all the information needed to judge a game without all the clutter.

Tech Stack:
Django, Python3, Bootstrap4, jQuery, SQLite3, Memcached, and AWS (EC2, CloudFront, S3, Route53).

Use cases:
Searching for ranked history by summoner name, searching multiple users in lobby, and searching for live game by summoner name.

Advantages over competitor products:
Ashwin.gg has an amazing mobile layout. While other products have more data, Ashwin.gg is cleaner and friendlier to look at, espsecially on mobile devices, without having to download anything or look at ads.
